I am a recent Makers Academy graduate with a BSc Mathematics degree from University of Manchester.

In my previous role I was an international Payroll Lead at Deliveroo where I was a SME focused on projects whilst overseeing BAU. Inspired by my peers and the tech/start-up culture, I finally decided to make a switch into Software Engineering. 

I am a determined and enthusiastic individual always willing to learn new skills. I have a proven track-record of delivering quality and I am determined to make an impact as a Software Engineer. 

I am looking for a role that enables learning and growth. Company culture is also very important to me.
